# Dashboard Components & Pages Specification

This document serves as the comprehensive blueprint for developing the user interface of the Modern Traffic Dashboard. It details every page, component, and their interactions with the backend API, ensuring a cohesive, feature-rich, and visually stunning application.

**Guiding Principles:**
- **Clarity & Simplicity:** Every component must be intuitive and easy to understand.
- **Actionable Intelligence:** Go beyond raw data. Each component must answer a key question for a traffic engineer or planner.
- **Real-time First:** The UI should feel alive, with data updating seamlessly via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **Consistency:** Adhere to the `DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` to maintain a unified look and feel.

## Server-Sent Events (SSE) Integration

### Components Using Real-time SSE Streams

The following components have been enhanced with **Server-Sent Events** for real-time data updates:

| Component | SSE Endpoint | Update Type | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **RealTimeActivityFeed** | `/api/sensors/stream` | System Events | Live alerts derived from sensor data |
| **MiniRiskHeatmap** | *Custom implementation* | Risk Updates | Real-time intersection risk scores |
| **DirectionalFlowGauges** | `/api/traffic/stream` | Traffic Data | Live vehicle flow rates by direction |
| **RealTimeMetricsTable** | `/api/traffic/stream` | Traffic Metrics | Speed, density, congestion levels |
| **LiveVehicleLog** | `/api/vehicles/stream` | Vehicle Events | New vehicle detections and classifications |
| **IntersectionCoordination** | `/api/coordination/stream` | Light Status | Traffic signal coordination updates |
| **SensorStatusGrid** | `/api/sensors/stream` | Sensor Health | Battery, temperature, connectivity status |

### SSE Implementation Guidelines

1. **Connection Management**: All SSE components use the `useServerSentEvents` hook for robust connection handling
2. **Error Handling**: Components display connection status and gracefully handle disconnections
3. **Data Buffering**: Events are buffered client-side with configurable limits (default: 100 events)
4. **Auto-Reconnection**: Failed connections automatically retry with exponential backoff
5. **Performance**: Event processing is optimized to prevent UI blocking

### Connection Status Indicators
